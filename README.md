# Artifact-Travelogues-
This project documents the movement of artifacts throughout time and makes it available for public access. The use of a Strapi database makes contributions beginner and non-programmer friendly. Contributors who are more comfortable with code are encouraged to make suggestions to improve the format, beginning in the discussions threads.  

## Organization 
The project will use Strapi in to store data. Fields include:
1. An image of the artifact 
2. The name of the artifact 
3. The origin of the artifact 
4. Where the artifact was located at different times
5. Ownership status of the artifact at different times


## Activities
* Create new entries for any artifacts that you think are worth researching. 
* Find and upload images files 
* Contribute information about the history of the artifact's movement. 
* Proofread and update information.



## Research tips
1. For good quality images, try Google Arts and Culture and museum websites.
2. Look for the *who, what, where and when.* For instance, take note of who (person or institution) owned the artifact, where it was located and for what period of time it was held in that place.
3. Use websites and other accessible online sources.

## Documenting external sources 
* List sources in point-form at the bottom of each "Description"

Example of Citation
